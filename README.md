# Workout Interval Timer
This is the second Milestone Project for the Code Institute course.

## UX

### - Strategy - What are we aiming to achieve and for whom?
#### For the user: 
- We want to create a website that is easy and intuitive to use.
- We want to create a site that is easy to view on all screen sizes.
- 

### - Scope - What features (based on information from the Strategy) do you want to include in your design? What's on the table and what's not(at least for now)?
- Intuitive user interface.
- Customizable work and rest times.
- Option for an extended break after a set number of rounds.
- Alarm or bell sound after rounds/breaks.
- Progress bar showing current position in workout.
- Options should be collapsable, to leave a minimal interface when timer is running.

### - Structure (How is the information structured and how is it logically grouped?)
- Single page layout.
- Simple logo at the top of the page.
- Options should expand below the logo and be collapsable.

### - Skeleton (How will our information be represented, and how will the user navigate to the information and the features?)
###### Wireframes:
- [Desktop](wireframes/desktop.png)
- [Mobile](wireframes/mobile.png)

### - Surface (What will the finished product look like? - What colors, typography, and design elements will we use?)
- Minimal interface.
- Contrasting accents for work/rest times to act as instant visual signal to users.


### - Planning
 - Timer function needss to differentiate between work & rest times.
 - When paused, current round number needs to be saved
 - Add all round times to get total runtime, keep track of elapsed time and compare to length of rounds to calculate current round.
